🛡️ SniffMaster - Advanced Real-Time Packet Sniffer CLI Tool SniffMaster is a powerful and user-friendly command-line packet sniffing tool designed for network analysis, diagnostics, and real-time traffic monitoring. It captures, analyzes, and categorizes packets by protocol (TCP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, DNS), providing instant insights and live statistics.

Ideal for Cybersecurity Professionals, Network Engineers, CTFs, and learners who want to dig deeper into the packet-level details of network communication.


🚀 Features ✅ Live Packet Capture with color-coded terminal output ✅ Real-Time Statistics for TCP, UDP, ARP, ICMP, DNS ✅ Packets Per Second (PPS) & Total Packet Counter ✅ .pcap Export: Save captures for Wireshark analysis ✅ Logging Support: Save packet logs to a file ✅ Customizable CLI Interface for better user control ✅ Lightweight & Easy to Use – Built with Scapy & Python

🧠 Use Cases 🛡️ Penetration Testing & Traffic Analysis

🧪 CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges

🧰 Debugging Network Applications
